This sentence is able to understand english through the synonym system. The synonym system (as thought of by toad1359) is a system that replaces all known words in a sentence with synonyms, again and again, till only the most basic words exist. Then by finding key words the system forms a response. Currently, key words are just understod words, as the dictionary is very tiny. After isolating words, a function is called (per word) to calculate the response, and the reponse (with only a few exceptions) will have the same sentence structure as the input. The words in the response will be synonyms calculated by RNG as to have variety.
