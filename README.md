# AIndrew (Pronounced Andrew)
This is an artificial intelligence in the works. It's goal is to talk, and learn. Some rigidness is to be expected. The name of it is AIndrew.

This AI is able to understand english through the synonym system. The synonym system (as thought of by toad1359) is a system that replaces all known words in a sentence with synonyms, again and again, till only the most basic words exist. Then by finding key words the system forms a response. Currently, key words are just understod words, as the dictionary is very tiny. After isolating words, a function is called (per word) to calculate the response, and the reponse (with only a few exceptions) will have the same sentence structure as the input. The words in the response will be synonyms calculated by RNG as to have variety. Implementation can be found in AI.java .
